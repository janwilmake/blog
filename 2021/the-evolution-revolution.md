# The Evolution Revolution

I have a vision of a good future where biology (plants and animals), humanity
and technology live together in harmony on earth. I call it [the ultimate
equilibrium](/2019/the-ultimate-equilibrium/). In this post I will describe how it
looks and how we could get there.

I see a world where animals and plants serve humanity instead of being so
hostile and selfish. Trees that grow into houses and animals that fetch and cook
our food. We humans are then free to focus on more important issues, like
exploring space, solving the climate problem, and becoming happy, satisfied, and
sustainable, preserving the earth and our current civilisation.

How the hell are we going to do that? Well, the answer lies in the evolution
revolution. We are already able to alter DNA. In the beginning, there was just
evolution that altered DNA. Later came the breeding of animals and plants by
humans. This, however, still relied on evolution and took a long time. Since
recently, it's possible to edit DNA with [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR). We don't know however, how these
alterations unfold in the real world. However, more recently, [AlphaFold](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaFold-Using-AI-for-scientific-discovery)
has given us the ability to understand how proteins fold. This is a step closer
to the goal of understanding  how biology works, and ultimately, how we can edit
DNA in a meaningful way. Because if we can do that reliably and without causing
too much pain in animals and plants we do it on, we are literally in control of
biology and how it will evolve. This is the evolution revolution.

When we are able to do this, we can create non-selfish animals and plants: trees
that grow into a house instead of growing in a way to catch as much
photosynthesis as possible, and animals that serve us whatever we like to eat.

We are then completely free. We don't need to build our homes anymore because
they are automatically grown. We don't need to find food because animals bring
it to us. We can focus our intelligence towards a greater goal. Expanding into
the universe and preserving earth in a condition that suits the human species to
survive for a very, very long time.

In a next post I will elaborate on the types of animals and plants that would be
useful for humanity: transportation animals, intelligent trees, farmers and
foragers, and more. Stay tuned.
