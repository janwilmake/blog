# What is Corona, really, and why should we change our mindset?

Corona is just a made-up thing. So are viruses. If enough people believe you, it
becomes reality. You just have to trust each other. Trust is the solution. 

Since we are getting more and more individual as people, and the platforms we
are on make us less and less sure about ourselves, it was rather easy to
convince everybody that corona existed and it was not a beer.

When internet arrived, people that were families before, became separated due to
them living in different 'internet bubbles'. 

Now, the dangers of the Corona infection make people that were close together
before in real life still, even more separated, because Corona lives in the real
world.
