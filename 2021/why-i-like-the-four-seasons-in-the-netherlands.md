# Why I like the four seasons in the Netherlands

I like the Winter in The Netherlands because of the snow and the Gezellity with
friends, playing games, inside.

I like the Spring (Lente) because of the first flowers, new animals, and the
love in the air.

I like the Summer (Zomer) because W (friends and me) can enjoy the outside
optimally, and you don't need to wear so many clothes, so you can B yourself!

I like the Autumn (Herfst) because of the scent and the little storms. Because
the water is still a bit warm from the summer, this creates the optimal
condition for wind water sports.

Maybe it's a bit late, but... Happy new year!
