# How I'm going to try to become 10x as productive within a month

A few simple new rules are going to make me much more productive.

 1. Chrome max 3 tabs
 2. No other browsers allowed
 3. Freedom.to locked mode: No news, no communication, no notekeeping, no bank,
    nothing. Just the sites I use for work can be accessed: NPM, GitHub, Docs,
    Medium...
 4. Install mail & slack on phone
 5. At home, give phone to my housemate (call him or ask him to unlock). Ask him
    max 10-60 minutes a day and maybe not at all.
 6. Use test phones (old iPhone and old Android phone) for developing.
 7. [Codebase first development](/2019/how-to-code-more-and-plan-less)



In April, I spent less than one hour per day in the code editor on average. This
is a record low. Time for change.



In May, my daily average goal is 10 hours (70 hours a week).

I know this can be done. I'm gonna show it to you.
