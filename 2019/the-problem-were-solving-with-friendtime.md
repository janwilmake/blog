# The problem we're solving with FriendTime

The problem
 1. Chaos Your contacts are scattered across all kinds of (social media)
    channels
 2. Privacy is gone Your data is sold and used to maximize profitability of you
    and your friends
 3. Sparse relationships The internet has grown the amount of people we interact
    with, but made every connection a lower quality one because we spend less
    time on every connection.
 4. Disconnectedness Internet connects the unconnected, but disconnects the
    connected. Average communication quality has become lower since the internet
    and text messaging/email has become the norm.
 5. Addiction Current social media business models are optimized for
    screen-time, which leads to addiction

The solution
 1. A Clear Overview Access all your friends and connections from one app.
 2. Privacy Your data is completely yours. We don't sell it. It doesn't even
    leave your phone!
 3. Choose for Meaning According to anthropologist Robin Dunbar, the limit of
    active stable relationships is 150. If you have more, this app helps you to
    get less connections, but more meaningful ones.
 4. Real Connections This app tends to get you off your phone and interact more
    in real life with the people that matter most to you. In this app, calling
    has priority over text-messages.
 5. Stop human downgrading FriendTime has a freemium business model - our goal
    is to make you a better person.
