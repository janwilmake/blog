description: Open sourcing React Native libraries including Super Image, Super Actionsheet, and Data Forms to share reusable components with the developer community.
---

# Today I open-sourced nearly 10% of my codebase

I tried to be more open source the past few weeks. My main codebase is still
private, but I've open sourced a few things:

 * React Native Super Image
   https://github.com/EAT-CODE-KITE-REPEAT/react-native-super-image
 * React Native Super Actionsheet
   https://github.com/EAT-CODE-KITE-REPEAT/react-native-super-actionsheet - A
   small wrapper around rn actionsheet
 * Communify Open https://github.com/EAT-CODE-KITE-REPEAT/communify-open - A
   place for ideas, plans, marketingstrategies, features and bug reports for
   Communify
 * React Native Data Forms
   https://github.com/EAT-CODE-KITE-REPEAT/react-native-data-forms - by far
   the biggest open source library I have now - it's 3300+ lines of code! Create
   beautiful forms that submit data to redux, a graphql mutation, or an api in
   many different input types

I hope the people that need them can find them!
