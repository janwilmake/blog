# The dark side of globalization

Decentralized internet (different content in different countries) is good. We
are doing a global experiment on ourselves and don’t know the long term effects.
E.g.: allow porn? Allow games? User retention? Instant connectionism to the
world from your pocket? Social media? Is it all good for us? Does it make a
sustainable earth possible? We don’t know yet.

Freedom is nice, but maybe it’s a little overrated. We are bad decision makers
because platforms are tricking us. We moved rather quickly from a text-based
internet to a picture based internet, and are now arriving at mostly video-based
content. AR/VR is going to be even more influential on our mind so better watch
out!

We can’t fuck up the whole planet if there are different platforms everywhere.
Different experiments.

Diversity is better for statistical analysis, statistical and knowledge.
Globalism is only good if we know the outcome.
