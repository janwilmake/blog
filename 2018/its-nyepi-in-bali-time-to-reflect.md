# It's Nyepi in Bali. Time to reflect

It's Saturday, the 17th of March 2018, and I woke up at 5:45 without alarm. It's
crazy what a routine can do to your body. In the last weeks, I woke up around 6
every morning, ran or surfed, meditated, take bulletproof coffee, and worked in
the most important task after that. In the evening I pursue my social needs and
I go to bed early. I call this EAT, CODE, KITE, REPEAT. I want to become the
best in my field, use these skills to do something meaningful and get paid for
it, live a healthy, adventurous life, and make the world a better place. And I
will not stop this routine anytime soon! Loving it.

So today I self-reflected. Who am I? What can I? What will I do?

Who am I?
To discover this, I reread a lot of my blogs, went through the code I wrote, and
thought about the things I created. If you want to know more about me, talk to
me. I'm not going to write about that on my blog much.

What can I?
I seem to be goal driven & adventurous. Again, I won't go into detail.

What will I do?
In January I created [this post](/2018/2018-year-of-creation) as a
goal for 2018. I can happily say that I'm well on my way!

Now I'm all in on building the app for communities to strive. The first goal is
to make this ultra scalable & valuable to as many people as possible. The next
goal will be about creating a more sustainable earth by designing the software &
scalable hardware to make this possible.

In order to do this, I want to create a Kite-Code Army that collaborates with a
Yoga-Passion Army in order to create One World. One World is the name of the
company that distributes any software & scalable hardware technology for a more
sustainable world.

That's it for now. Back to coding.
