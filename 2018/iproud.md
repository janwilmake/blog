# Meet iProud: The productivity app for entrepreneurs!

In November 2017 I created the first version of this app: iProud. See the
website for more info [https://iproud.co]

iProud is the ultimate To-Do app for entrepreneurs. Make & share to-do lists,
get shit done, and meet & connect with other entrepreneurs!

Here are some screenshots.





It took me about 2 weeks to build this, but it took me about 6 months of failed
projects and learning tutorials and courses before that!

I am very happy that I came this far. I released it in beta, let some friends go
on the platform, and got feedback. Then I noticed that there are a lot of things
that have to be better, so I decided to stop this project and maybe pick it up
later.

If you are interested in the idea... And you know react native... Let me know!
