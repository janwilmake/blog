# Know Thyself. But how?

I forget things. I read things multiple times without seeing the connection. I
went to Tarifa 3 years ago, but I forgot most bars/cafe's I went to. It will
happen again if I don't safe it somewhere! Because of fractured attention and
stress, we are beoming more forgetful. What if there was a google for your mind.
A  platform that helps you connect the dots, learn more about yourself, and
helps you become a better thinker? 

What if there was a platform that lets you save all your opinions and reviews of
things you ever did/watched/read/have an opinion about in one place. Safe
articles, books, movies, music, places, pictures, your diary, and your goals
into one app. 

I might make this. Does this interest you? Let me know.

UPDATE: I started building this. 


Why:

- People forget and are unable to access many memories because there is no link
to it.


Goal:

- MindMirror is the mirror to clearly see into your mind. 

- Better remind your past

- Learn about yourself: know thyself

- Intelligently analyze your experiences so you can connect the dots

- Share your life with others that are close to you


What:

 - Intelligently add tags to entries

- Be able to search through locations, tags, dates.
