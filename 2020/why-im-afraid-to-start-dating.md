# Why I'm afraid to start dating

 1. I got nothing to talk about
 2. I'm too boring
 3. I don't know if I like you
 4. I don't know if you like me

These are all dumb reasons but they're the reason why I don't date. 

I'm not boring, I've got lots to talk about
The question is whether or not the other person finds it interesting. And that's
what dating is for to find out. 

See dating as a game
Dating is a game in which you have to find out if you like someone. If you
don't, no worries, that happens. 

If she doesn't like you, no man overboard
It's better to figure that out as quickly as possible, and don't waste several
dates. Be honest with each other and just stop dating if you don't like each
other. 

Sex on the first date
After a long while dry it can be a scary thought to have sex again. But you
don't have to have sex on the first date! Just focus on having a good time, and
don't worry about the sex.

It's Covid time, no dating allowed
Fuck that. 

Getting rejected
It's a natural fear to fear being rejected because you could get kicked in the
nuts or worse: get a bad social status in your whole tribe: much less success
with other wimen too. However, this is not the case anymore. We don't live in
tribes and women aren't that aggressive in general. So just try and not give a
f*ck about this fear. Neglect it. It's not real anymore.
