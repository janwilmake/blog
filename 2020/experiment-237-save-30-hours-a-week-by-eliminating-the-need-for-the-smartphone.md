# Experiment #237: Save 35 hours a week by eliminating the need for the smartphone

I've tried many times and many things to spend less time on my smartphone.
However, whatever I tried, after a while I always got back to my smartphone. In
the last month, on average, I spent around 5 hours a day on my smartphone. Which
is a lot of time! It's about a third of my time that I'm awake that I'm checking
my mail, scrolling Insta, TikTok, or Facebook, and replying on WhatsApp. 

The hypothesis this time is that I spend so much time because your phone is
always right beside you, giving you an opportunity to start scrolling whenever
you feel a bit bored. This makes it so much easier to waste time on your phone
compared to on your computer. 

Also, on your computer, you got more screen real-estate, and you can type
faster, so you're more productive. So what if I could spend all the time I spend
on my phone (or part of it) on my laptop? 

I eliminated the need for my phone! All things that I can do on my phone, I can
also do on my Mac now! Calling, WhatsApp, Messenger, Email, everything. Of
course, it is a bit more uncomfortable sometimes, but that doesn't matter. If
it's less convenient, I may not get into the habit of doing it while dreaming.
The habit of 'dreamscrolling' will be eliminated!

Whenever I go out and meet up with someone and need my phone, I do take it with
me, so the need for my phone is not completely eliminated, but for whenever I'm
home - which is like 95% of the time - it is. 

Let's see where this experiment leads me. I will show you RescueTime reports in
a month! I'm always on a mission to become more productive and conscious of my
time and how I spend it. Do you want to learn what I learn? Subscribe.
