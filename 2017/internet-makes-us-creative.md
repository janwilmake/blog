# Google makes us creative, but also more self-determined

Today I was listening to Drum & Bass when I thought: 'What if this would be
classical? That would be epic!' So I searched for 'Drum & Bass classical', and 
voila https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb-LkBkFb_Y! Somebody made it 7 years
ago. There are much more situations like this. There is a pattern that uncommon
thoughts we put on the internet can be found by others. Normally, this kind of
thoughts would end because it doesn't exist.

When you search things on Google, it always exists, so I often find myself
lookup up a combination of two random words I know because I think that would
make sense to exist, and almost always it exists. Sometimes it is phrased a
little different, but because of the pattern of always being able to find
something like it, I think you become more creative and more self-determined and
certain.

If you compare this to real life situations, I often find myself talking to
people, and when I am getting creative, putting random words together that make
sense to me, the answer is often something like 'Nah, that's not possible' or
'That doesn't exist' or 'I don't know man' or 'No, you're wrong, it's like this
and this.' (unless you're both drunk).



I really think this is a big distinction between Real Life and Google. Google
gives you positive feedback on creativity while most real life situations don't.

Obviously, another big pattern of Google is that you can directly get to know
things you want to know. In real life this is not the case.

That's why I think people that spend a lot of time on Google become more
creative and smart.

However... There is also a drawback about Google, because there is the
self-confirmation pattern. You're always right, and you not always get to see
the other, more common perspective. Google is an echo chamber of our own
thoughts, which makes us more self-determined because we often seem to be right.
In real life, other perspectives cause us to think which make us more
open-minded.

So yeah... That's my perspective, and this time I didn't want to be biased by
google, so I made it all up. What's yours? And if you found this using Google,
please let me know. That would totally confirm my theory!
