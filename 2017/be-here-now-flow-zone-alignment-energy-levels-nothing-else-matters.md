# My energy levels in Eat Code Kite Repeat: Being in alignment with your environment

Creating my first MVP Mobile-App isn't easy. It takes a lot of energy and trust
in yourself to keep doing it. Creating an MVP takes a lot of mental energy. At
the end of a regular 8-hour coding day I am totally finished. After sitting in a
chair for 8 hours (or longer) I got so much energy and need to express myself.
That's when I need a kite session.



Roughly seen, these are my mental and physical energy levels.

Nothing else matters
I assembled this house because it is all I need and all I want right now. I want
to be able to have work hard with other entrepreneurs and developers on our own
projects. At the end of the day I don't want to return to a hostel and party. I
don't want to return to an AirBNB and be lonely. I don't want to have to arrange
all kinds of stuff with friends over and over again. I just want to be in an
environment in which this all goes automatically.

I don't want to have to commute all the time. I don't want to have to go to the
gym to work out. This is a waste of time and energy!

Now that I have this environment, nothing else matters. I don't need to look at
my phone anymore. For almost nothing. Ten minutes a day is enough. I have all
people around me that I need to have. I can forget the rest for a while, and
focus completely on here and now. Be in the zone. Be in flow. Be in alignment.
What ever you want to call it.

If nothing else matters it becomes much easier to focus on my mission:

 1. Build a community
 2. Build an MVP
 3. Launch the MVP for the community
 4. Enjoy the process

No stress involved! It all flows automatically in the right direction, because I
became in alignment with my environment.
