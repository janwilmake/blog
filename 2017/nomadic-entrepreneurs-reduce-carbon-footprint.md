# 4 ways nomadic entrepreneurs can reduce their Carbon Footprint

There are two ways to decrease your carbon footprint
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint: using energy created without
carbon emission, or using less energy in the first place. There are also two
ways to use energy: directly and indirectly.

If you are living nomadic, it is not so easy to control which energy you use.
You don't know if Hotels or Restaurants use reusable energy unless you see they
have solar panels, which never happened to me before. Nonetheless, there are
many ways to decrease your carbon footprint compared to living a settled down
life, and sometimes you might not even have noticed it! Here are some ways in
which you can (or already are) decreasing your Carbon Footprint.

Dude, what is a carbon footprint!?
Your carbon footprint is basically how much CO² is created because of your
actions. According to MyClimate https://www.myclimate.org, an average EU
citizen uses an average of 9.1 tons of CO² per year. To halt climate change,
this has to be 2 tons.

Use less
 * The biggest carbon footprint a nomad uses, is flying and driving. MyClimate
   says a flight from Amsterdam to Bangkok, which is about 9.200 km, uses 1.7
   tons of CO². This is a lot of CO² for just one flight. Yeah. That's where we
   suck. We use lots of CO² because we are traveling a lot, and most travel us
   currently still using CO². So think twice about going back and forth between
   countries. Sharing cars, buses and trains is emitting way less!

'Updated Comparison of Energy Use & CO 2 Emissions From Different Transporte
Modes, Octubre 2008' (Manchester, NH: M.J. Bradley & Associates, 2008)


 * Nomadic entrepreneurs often make use of public facilities, which are more
   efficient because groups of people are sharing the same energy. They don't
   have their own laundry machine, dryer, kitchen or lawnmower. This all
   decreases the carbon footprint, both directly and indirectly.
   
   
 * Nomadic entrepreneurs often don't have a car. They go with public transport
   or sometimes even cycle or walk. Public transport is shared which makes it
   more efficient, and cycling or walking completely omits the direct carbon
   footprint.
   
   
 * Nomadic entrepreneurs often eat outdoors, which increases the possibilities
   to choose for locally produced and unprocessed foods, and reduces the effort
   to do so.

footprint? Let me know and I will add it to this article.
