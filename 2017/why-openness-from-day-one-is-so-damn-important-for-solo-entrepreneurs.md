# Why openness from day one is so damn important for solo entrepreneurs in software

Why you shouldn't keep your startup project to yourself, and why you should
share the process with the world? It may sound counter-intuitive but...

 1. Feedback can make you change your mind and plans
    
    
 2. ‎Others may learn from the value you share, and will, therefore, be eager to
    share value with you
    
    
 3. ‎You are socially under pressure because people expect you to share things
    and make progress. Therefore you will.
    
    
 4. Giving makes you happy and working on a product longterm without feedback or
    results can make you depressed. Share!
    
    

Don't spew out all the secret sauce, but give people a little taste of the soup
you're making, and let them know some ingredients.
