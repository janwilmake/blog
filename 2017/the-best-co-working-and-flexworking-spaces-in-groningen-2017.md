# The Best Co-Working and Flexworking spaces in Groningen 2017

Launch Café

Launch your startup in this awesome co-working space. They offer a €2 lunch
every day which is great to socialize with other entrepreneurs.
Price: €100 per month, €125 per 10x, or €15 per day.

The Big Building

This enormous building is going to be demolished next year, but until then it's
the perfect place for startups to grow. They only really use the second floor in
this 5 floor building. Make sure you contact them before going there, because
you need a card to go in!
Price: unknown

De uurwerker

This place is more like a café and restaurant but it also has co-working places.
You can sit there for free with fast WiFi and electricity, and lunch, snacks,
coffee or even dinner can be ordered while working!
Price: Free

Wadapartja

It’s amazing. People with tablets here, people having business conversations,
etc, etc. You really hear something’s going on here. This is really a nice place
to do some business. Of course, wadapartja and de uurwerker are a little bit
more oriented on people that come together and talk. It’s not really a place to
go into deep concentration because there’s also beer, music, and a lot of chit
chat. But it’s still possible! They have electricity, WiFi, and you can easily
order food and coffee.
I really like the concept of wadapartja and de uurwerker, although it’s kind of
strange.
People that go here really seem to be hard-working modern people.
I would totally recommend this if you have a business meeting or something. They
don’t look weird at you if you stay here for 3 hours and both take laptops out
of your bag, it’s made for it here!
If you want to work the whole day alone, I would go somewhere else. It would be
easier to concentrate. In here, it's too easy to relax! But nothing is
impossible. I'm typing this from here.

Do you know any other places where you can work and network short-term? Let me
know, as I want to try them all in Groningen, and post my findings here.
