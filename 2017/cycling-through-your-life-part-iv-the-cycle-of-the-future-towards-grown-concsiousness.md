# Cycling through your life part IV - The cycle of the future: towards grown consciousness

I have drawn this when I compared life with a bicycle. It's a little strange,
this metaphor, but it makes you think!



Homo sapiens have a neo-cortex that allows them to reflect before they take
action; They are more conscious than animals. In the western world, the bicycle
seems to have changed just like the consciousness of their creators, if you see
the rear wheel as internal information processing and the front wheel as
external. :-) I don't know about 2200 though.
