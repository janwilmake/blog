# 4 Reasons Writing Makes You A More Succesful Entrepreneur

Basically, there are 4 reasons why I post articles on this website.

 1. It makes you more open Blogging teaches you to share your knowledge and
    experiences with others. You become more open.
    
    
 2. It helps you reaching goals Blogging lets others know more about you and
    your goals. If they like you're doing, they will react to your goals in a
    way that may help you achieving them more easily, using their network and
    knowledge. Also, you can put challenges in the open, so it's an extra reason
    to achieve them, because it will be bad for your image if you don't achieve
    your challenges.
    
    
 3. It's Networking 2.0 See it as a way of networking. Instead of just talking
    to one person, you talk to all your subscribers, which is way more
    efficient.
    
    
 4. It keeps your thoughts organized I use writing as a way to organize and
    pinpoint my thoughts. I think a lot and I have a habit of writing down
    important thoughts in notes anyway. I might as well post some of my thoughts
    online if it can be useful to others.
