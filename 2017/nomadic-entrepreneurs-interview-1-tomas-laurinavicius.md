# Nomadic Entrepreneurs Interview #1 - Tomas Laurinavicius

I get inspired by lots of other nomadic entrepreneurs. Today, I interviewed
Tomas, a nomadic entrepreneur from Lithuania.

Where are you now?
Right now I am in Vilnius, Lithuania. I’ll stay here for the summer before
heading to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.

What do you do for a living and why?
I’m a lifestyle entrepreneur and blogger. That involves writing, designing,
managing a remote team, networking and selling. I like to make ideas happen,
being lifestyle entrepreneur and blogger I have a lot of freedom to create and
design a dream lifestyle. I value freedom and meaningful work.

How did you start? How long did it take you to achieve making enough money while
traveling to sustain yourself?
I started a decade ago. I self-taught Photoshop and started blogging about
design. Then year after year I was putting in work and getting better. 3 years
ago, I made a decision to travel the world and work while doing it. It’s
incredible. I learned so much, grew as a person and met amazing people.

Tell us about your passions, dreams, hobbies and life goals?
I’m obsessed with freedom, lifestyle design, personal finance and health. I’m
writing a book about the habits of success with an intention to empower 1
million people to change their lifestyle for good.

Do you have collaborations that help you grow your business or keep you
traveling? If so, what kind of collaborations? Do you think it’s hard to
maintain these collaborations remotely?
If you are talking about work, then yes, all of my work is remote and people or
businesses I work with don’t see a problem with it. We have Skype, Slack, email,
it’s all you need for an active collaboration anywhere in the world. Add
transparency, honesty and commitment and you have a great environment to work
in.

What are the hardest challenges and biggest struggles for you as a
location-independent entrepreneur?
Travel management gets quite tedious. Researching the next destination, booking
flights and hotels, finding the gym, coffee shops and more. Other than that is
probably lack of belonging.

In what kind of way will your entrepreneurship impact the world?
I believe there is no one truth. There are many ways to live healthy, happy and
meaningful life. I experiment with diets, exercises, business ideas, lifestyle
hacks and document my journey. People can’t change unless they want it. My job
is to show the alternative path and hope for the best. I’m constantly inspired
by people who step out of their comfort zones to grow and I will do the same to
experience life to the full and hopefully empower 1 million people to change
their lifestyle for good.

Do you have any tips for people that want to study and work on the move?
Take full responsibility if your life. It really starts with the mind. Make a
clear picture of where you want to be what you want to do and take action. If
you don't know where to start, ask. But don’t just wait and blame the world.
Your job is to figure it out. For some it may take a year, for me, it took
nearly a decade. Time will pass anyway, better do something to reach your dream.
