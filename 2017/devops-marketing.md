# Cycling through your life part II - DevOps vs. Marketing in software companies

Don't you hate advertisements? Well, I do. I wish we lived in a world without
them, but because they are there - very presently nowadays on the internet, as
they have become the business model of Facebook, Google and what not - we have
to compete with them. However, Just like Elon Musk, I believe a truly good
product doesn't need advertisements at all, and a book I read recently confirmed
my thoughts. Read on...

 * Paying for advertisements is often a waste of money.
 * If you really have a product that customers need, want and use, they will
   market the product for you, for free.
 * Instead of wasting money on marketing, think of smart ways of implementing
   marketing in your product. [I really enjoyed this book: Growth Hacker
   Marketing: A Primer on the Future of PR, Marketing, and Advertising

The Dev Ops paradigm is all you need to build a great product, and if you don't
understand your market well enough, which most companies don't, you better make
sure to make it quick.


What works on the internet often works very well for life too. I think DevOps is
very appliable on life in general too! Just think about it..
