# 5 Reasons why Groningen is underrated as a place for Digital Nomads

Nothing tops Groningen: City of Talent. Student city. Cycling city. The city
that feels like a village. Groningen is all of it. Instead of going to Amsterdam
I would recommend nomadic entrepreneurs and digital nomads to check out
Groningen once. It's just a €7 Flixbus https://flixbus.nl away from Amsterdam,
and the weed is just as good. Groningen is my hometown. I think it's a really
good place for nomadic entrepreneurs and digital nomads to stay. As of the 5th
of July, it pops up at the 13th place on Nomad List http://nomadlist.com,
which is quite good for such a small city. Nevertheless, it's still rather
uncommon for digital nomads to go there. Time to raise awareness!



5 Reasons to check it out
One
It's rather cheap to live and easy to find short term rent: Rent is about twice
as cheap as in Amsterdam.

Two
There are many co-working spaces and free work facilities like the library. I
prefer Launch Café http://launchcafe.nl because it is very centrally located
and it organizes a €2,- lunch every day, where you can meet other entrepreneurs.


Three
There is amazing nightlife. Besides the Poelestraat, where you can find cheap
(€1-€2.50) beer all night every night, we often have bigger parties like this
one, in the middle of the big market:


Four
There are many students, which brings a lot of talent. Out of a population of
202k, there are about 55k students. With 27%, this is the biggest percentage of
students I know of in any city. Please contact me if you know a city with a
bigger percentage of students.


> This is Zernike Complex, where most students study.


Five
You don't need a car here. Public transport is fine, but I would advise buying a
cheap bike. You can find cheap second-hand bikes on Marktplaats
http://marktplaats.nl, or ask me, because I sell one for €50 as of June 2017.

Going from one side of Groningen to the other just takes half an hour. Within
the city center, you're often faster on a bike than with a car.


That's it for now. If you have other questions about Groningen, just ask me. I'm
here to help, and I will add answers to this article later!
