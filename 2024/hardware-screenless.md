description: Argues against the need for new hardware for AI assistants, proposing that existing simple phones paired with good headphones can deliver bidirectional voice interfaces effectively.

For the last months I've been busy building a personal AI at [Screenless](https://screenless.org) and I am silently launching it and starting to test with early adopters. I'm inspired by my predecessors like [Humane](https://hu.ma.ne/) with the AI Pin and [Rabbit Tech](https://rabbit.tech) with their Rabbit R1. Also the [Tab](https://mytab.ai/) is great.

What I keep seeing though is that all of them want to make new hardware, and I don't think it's really needed. Is this just dumb ambitiousness trying to make the next smartphone, not seeing that the hardware is already sufficient? Or maybe it's a way to market the product better? Good for visibility?

Whatever it is, my vision is different. All Screenless really needs is quick calling: a quick establishing of a call through whatever way:

Some options include:

- voice activation
- actionbutton

But most importantly, it's cool to have some sort of stylish piece of hardware that people can talk see, as what you wear identifies you.

The Nokia phone is known for its durability and simplicity and especially great value for money.

[This one](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/nokia-105-neo-4mb-zwart-dual-sim/9200000117591479/?bltgh=rll32DERxevi2yTkrl5LTw.2_41.42.ProductTitle) also is very stylish.

A good pair of headphones attached and an Action Button set on the phone to call screenless, as well as the ability for the headphones to activate that same actionbutton would be superb.

Ultimately, AI can deliver pretty much anything over a bidirectional voice interface.

If the small LED screen can be somehow connected to signals send over the voice signal as well, that would be epic, but not needed initially. But its good to know that this would potentially also be possible, and I'm sure it is, but we need a bigger collaboration for that.

Ultimately, I think conversations with existing and outdated cellphone companies (like Nokia, Sony Eriksson, or Chinese ones) could be super beneficial.

I will probably put more effort into this in the future, or maybe the dots magically connect!
