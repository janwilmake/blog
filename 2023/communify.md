# Communify

Everyone needs a brotherhood, mentors and mentees, and a partner. Humans have lived in such an environment for hundreds of thousands of years and the fabric of society has changed a lot in the last centuries, which led to the fact that not everyone has this anymore.

This causes mass chronic stress and depression.

Along the same lines of **purpose driven openness** we can create an algorithm that will maximise the utility of these communities of people by suggesting your perfect community.

If we also reduce friction of moving we might be able to cluster people together for maximizing communal perfection.

This will reduce the need for screentime drastically and make us human again.
