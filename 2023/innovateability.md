description: Proposes a new system called "purpose driven openness" that uses LLMs to calculate alignment between entities, enabling innovation while preventing misuse of shared technologies.

# Increasing innovateability

- competitive capitalism incentivizes us to pull up the ladder and prevent competition
- it also incentivizes to be less transparent to prevent competition
- pulling up the ladder prevents competition, which creates gravitating pull to using your company
- if you prevent competition it also becomes much harder to innovate, because often, to innovate you need to do something on top of the other company.
- therefore we can say that pure capitalism greatly slows down our societies innovation
- of course, capitalism also promotes creating better things because it will create profits which is highly aligned with success.

Can we come up with a system that doesn't limit innovateability?

# Proposing: **purpose driven openness**

- Up until now, most companies either don't share things at all, they share things with a limited set of partners, or they share it completely publicly.
- The problem of sharing publicly is that lots of technologies are double-edged swords, i.e. they can be used for good and bad. If we create a powerful technology and share it publicly, it'll be good for innovation but it will also innovate bad applications, so it may not be much aligned with your purpose.
- The advantage to not sharing at all and sharing it openly publicly is that it takes very little work. However, it is very black and white, and prevents many companies from sharing.
- With the coming of LLM's it has become much easier to analyse the nature of companies, people and other entities.

What if we can build a system that calculates `purposeAlignment` and `purposeAlignmentCertainty` between you and other entities? What if we had this for all other entities in the world? Based on this, we can create a flexible openness that ensures allows innovation to move forward in areas that align with our pursose while limiting innovation in areas that we don't believe in.

# Post capitalism

If we all had enough money to be healthy and happy, we probably wouldn't care so much about money. Our values and purpose will become a bigger driver. If we completely take "making money" out of the equation, it would probably become much easier to innovate because it would remove the friction of selling and buying things.

In a hunter gatherer society it was possible to keep a mental model of all purpose/value alignement in your head for the whole tribe, because it wasn't that big. In current societies we have scaled out of this, and it's not possible anymore. We often base our trust on what others think and quick shallow estimations.

A tool that globally estimates inter-purpose-alignment between all parties could be a great accelerator for innovation.

Let's make it reality.
