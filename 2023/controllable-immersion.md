# Controllable Immersion

I want to eat healthy
I want to be healthy
I want to belong
I want to be happy
I want to not be addicted or distracted
I want this for me, my family, friends, and, if possible, the whole world.

We all want this, or at least most of us.

Current society and technology makes it quite hard though to make this possible. There are many companies, people, and other entities, that make this obviously harder in favor of profit.

We're being hacked because society and technology taps into our primal instincts and emotions.

Up until now, regulations that make the above easier to accomplish always had to be implemented at scale.

AR will make it possible to implement things at a more indidividual level. What if you could choose that all suger sodas (and their ads) need to become invisible and muted? They would just be removed from your reality?

In the phisical world it is a harder challenge to accomplish full 24/7 AR.

In the digital world (e.g. on screens) it is more feasible.

I'm building my Human OS because I believe we need to be more in control of our digital immersion. Besides being in control of who I give my data to, I want to interact with computers without being manipulated.
