# E2E Testing ChatGPT AI plugins with using MRKL

ChatGPT's [AI plugins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins) allow ChatGPT to access realtime data and functionality. It creates a bridge between the LLM transformer world and rule-based classical computers. The technology behind is is called [MRKL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00445) and it's pretty genious. Simply said, you give the LLM a specification of functions it can call and ask it which one needs to be called based on the users input. OpenAI also opened up this technology as the [function calling api](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates).

Plugins are amazing but they aren't easy to do well. There are many things you need to think about and one of them is quality assurance. So we need to test! Of course, we can monkey-test and just test and confirm the quality manually every time we change something, but this will not guarantee the quality in the future. It seems therefore logical to create end-to-end tests for AI Plugins by imitating the underlying MRKL of OpenAI as much as possible.

Let's get to work!

# What I'll build

I'm creating three important functionalities.

For one, I want an endpoint that recursively goes between executing a plugin function and regular text completion using the MRKL idea behind ChatGPT plugins. I'll call this `capableTextToTextRecursive`.

The second functionality is a wrapper around that and `jsonGpt` called `testAiPlugin`. It allows you to provide your plugin(s) and some inputs that you want it to be tested with.

The third functionality is generating testcases: an array of strings that will be input into `testAiPlugin`. I'll call this `generateAiPluginTestCases`. It will use an LLM to generate a sequence of inputs that can be ran as tests.

# Results

I tested `testAiPlugins` on the ScrapingBee AI plugin I made recently. The initial results are shown below.

As can be seen, most testcases were a success, a couple failed. It could not find weather in new york (for some reason it failed) and it could not find the release date of the latest avenger movie.

I'm not sure if there are any false positives. Further testing of testing is needed.

# Testing your own ai-plugin

I've made `testAiPlugins` available in my API. You can submit your plugin(s) via `submitPlugin` to then test them automatically... Let me know if you have any problems with it or any other inquiries!

# Conclusion

Great start, but improvement needed.

- test cases need to cover more and be better in genral following some guidelines (be more explicit)
- we need to have better error logging to understand why the plugin is not good
- we need to be able to see visual results for images using image to text. same for voice realm...
- we need to test for a broader range of plugins and see
