# Agent-Friendly blog

This repo contains my writing from 2023-2025. It also allows hosting this as a website that is accessible through human browsers while also making the original markdown accessible through [llms.txt]. Besides that, it also allows adding stuff from other locations on the internet such that you can keep things in one place using the [.url standard](https://contextarea.com/whats-the-best-mos-c681oymolatc1r)

[This was the definition](https://contextarea.com/rules-httpsuithu-6kxr3bet0pa8wm) for creating the initial version and can still be further refined.

You can use this repo as a template and put your own blog (using markdown) in it.
