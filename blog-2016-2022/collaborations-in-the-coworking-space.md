# Collaborations in the coworking space often rely on coincidence

It's Tuesday afternoon in Canggu Bali and I'm in the biggest coworking space in
town: Dojo Bali. I've never been in a coworking space with such a great
community: So many nice people, and so many great events! But still this
happens:

I hear a conversation down the floor... 'So you do game development, right? -
Yeah, I do. So you wanted to talk? How did you know I was here? - Oh, well...
yeah... it's kind of a coincidence! I saw a post from you on Twitter!'...

Coincidence. That's where our connections often are based on still. Even in
2018. Even with all these technologies. Even professionally.

We have so many tools nowadays to meet other people! Facebook, Instagram,
Twitter, Tinder... They're all used for professional contacts as well. Even
though LinkedIn is originally created for it, it doesn't seem to be used a lot
here in Dojo...

The importance of networking
Networking is very important for your career. If you succeed to connect to the
right people it can give your career a big boost. The more you do this right,
the more successful you will be. Also for digital nomads, your career depends on
the connections you make. As a few Irish drunks once teached me, when I was in
Prague in July 2017:

> It's not what you know, it's who you know. -- some drunk Irish fellas


The problem is location, you dumb nomad!
Location of digital nomads changes often, so it's not easy to meet people you
find online. Often you find yourself looking at social media like Facebook and
Instagram, and sometimes you find someone you actually meet where you are at
that moment. But is this efficient? Probably not.

What if there was a platform that made it possible to easily find others near
you and told you what they do professionally? Location independence is great,
but if we don't watch out we may totally get disconnected from our surroundings.
We need a platform that stimulates local interactions and collaboration. Maybe
you can also find that programmer you hire on Upwork in this very coworking
space, but you just don't know it, because you don't know who programs in
Python, and you don't know who's looking for more work!

I believe that a local collaboration is always better than a distant
collaboration. So I am building Communify [https://communify.cc]: A platform to
enhance coworking communities to the next level, and boost your career through
some epic networking help!

A beta is currently in progress, so stay tuned for more, and contact me if you
want to collaborate. I'm in Dojo! (At least, I am now! hehehe)
