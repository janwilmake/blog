# I don't know or I don't flow

The past year I've lived according to a plan of going to a new city every few
weeks. I started with backpacking in Nepal, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar and
Vietnam. Then I started working in Chiang Man, Groningen, Hamburg, Prague,
Berlin, Budapest, Bansko, Lisbon... The longest I've been in one place was a
mere month in Chiang Mai.

I did all this, having a pretty clear plan, especially after being at home in
Groningen, it became very strict (being in the more expensive Europe had a lot
to do with this). I prefer having no plan and focus on having the most fun and
positive environment instead. If a place bores me or doesn't fit my needs
anymore, or people don't inspire me... I move on. If a place (and its people)
are fun, and I enjoy it a lot, and am able to achieve a good amount of my
goals... Then why should I move on?

The last few months have been quite stressful to be honest. I pushed myself to
work a lot, and around that I tried to meet many people, explore many things,
and learn a few habits. Every 2-3 weeks I entered a totally different
environment, which forces me out of my old habits and forces me to put energy
into creating new ones.

My philosophy remains the same: A travel life with a habit of change can be very
good for your development. Unfortunately, ones energy is limited, so for greater
efficiency and focus on work, a more stable environment is probably better...
And that's what I need right now.

Normally, I've had a clear and rather specific answer to the question of "How
long are you staying here?"

But now I've got a new answer:

> I don't know.


Tomorrow I'm going to Tarifa. I'm very exited to be able to live for one of my
greatest passions for a while: kitesurfing.
