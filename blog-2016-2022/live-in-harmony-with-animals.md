[https://www.boredpanda.com/magpies-recycling-machine-bottle-caps/]This is
amazing. Birds cleaning up the trash for humans. All kinds of animals can do
this. It's much better than making robots that do the same. If we don't want
animals to go extinct, we better not be indifferent about them, so if we put
them to good use, we actually care about them.

Cats are cozy.

Dogs protect you.

Horses were used to go from A to B.

Bees make plants grow.

Cows give milk

Chickens give eggs.

Doves were used to send letters. 

What if bigger birds could deliver food and small packages, instead of drones?

What if monkeys could clean up your house instead of a robot?

What if birds could clean up the trash?

It's probably possible, and I prefer to live in a world with animals serving us
rather than robots getting this task.
