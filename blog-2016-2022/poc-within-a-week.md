# MVP within a week

My expertise is creating a proof of concept of any app idea in within a week.
I've done this multiple times, see an example here
[https://karsens.com/i-just-made-an-app-in-26-hours/].

What will you get?

 * Together, we work out an MVP Specification that can be built within a week
   (this takes a couple of hours)
 * I pick pieces of all other apps I ever worked on or created together to
   puzzle together a rough start for this app
 * Together with a small team of programmers, I work out the app and create a
   first version of the app that works and can be used.
 * The app will be thoroughly tested on all types of phones, small and big, new
   and old, iOS and Android.
 * A designer will be hired to create a logo and other assets.
 * The app will be published to the Android Play Store and iOS App Store (And,
   if you want, it will be released publicly. If you don't want this, it will
   stay in BETA for people you can invite yourself)
 * Extensive documentation and instructions are given for your next developer to
   continue working on this codebase without any technical debt.
 * The whole app is future proof. It's written in simple, elegant, readable
   React Native, Node JS, and SQL in an efficient and scalable way.

Sometimes, I can't finish a working app within a week, while I promised this on
the first day. Whenever this happens, I'll continue working on it until it's
done.

Sometimes, an MVP can't be made within a week. For example, if it needs a
complex backend, machine learning, or other things. But on the first day, we can
work it out and see if it's possible. If it's not possible, I can still work on
an app for you, but it might cost a little more.

Sometimes, the review process of Apple gives the release of the app a small
delay. Most of the times, it can be published within a few working days, but
I've had it taking a few weeks.
