# #to{anything}

Lately, I've been working on my workflow a lot and gained a lot of consciousness
on my screen habits. Then, I made some rules to make me even more conscious and
less impulsive.

The hashtag
I now use #toRemember, #toSearch, #toSay  when I have a urge to write something
down, search something unimportant, or say something to someone, while I'm
working. But when it's  time to work, I should work. Therefore, I remind myself
with these hashtags, and only process them between 3pm and 8pm.

#to{anything} makes me more self-reflective and less impulsive before I actually
do something. Also, it clusters similar actions together for more focus.
