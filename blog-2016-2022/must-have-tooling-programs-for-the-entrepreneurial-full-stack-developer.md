# Must have Tooling & Programs

> This article is part of a series on building an MVP of a Data-driven
cross-platform app with the following stack: React Native, Apollo GraphQL, and
on the backend Node JS with Express and a MySQL Database.


These are the programs I use for developing react native apps.

 * VSCode
 * Make zsh, oh my zsh & zsh auto suggestions work in VSCode
 * Have ESLint and Prettier setup correctly
 * XCode

Some productivity apps/tools:

 * RescueTime: I have the paid version because it's awesome.
 * WakaTime: see how much time you spend in your editor.

Actually, there's a lot more.
