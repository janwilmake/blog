# Be conscious!

I just found this image. There are more nice graphical descriptions of
consciousness but this one resonates with me a lot! I'm planning to reach level
7 as soon as possible, and on my own terms!



Right now, I seem to be stuck at level 4-5ish. But it won't be long before I
have my product ready for production and can start making a difference. Hooray!
