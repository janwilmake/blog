# Pivoting to a creation-centric metric of productivity

My measure of my own productivity has changed several times in the past years.
The last few weeks I have been spending a lot of time learning passively, and it
bugged me that I didn’t get anything done. I didn’t make a lot of progress on my
own app because I needed to learn.

The last months I have been putting my own model of productivity in practice: to
divide work equally between learning, creating, sharing and talking. I have 
written about this [/hawk-view-entrepreneur-needs] before.

But now I propose a new model.



As you can see it starts with learning. By learning you create a vision and a
plan of creation. Then you start creating. And when the creating process goes
well, you can start talking about it and sharing your insights. The thing is
that this will work better because it puts creation first. I believe that if you
can’t get any deep creative work done, sharing and talking wouldn’t have much
value because there isn’t anything new. Also there wouldn’t be much reason to
keep learning because it starts to feel like you’re not using it.

How do you measure your productivity?
First I didn’t measure my productivity… When I just strated my startup, I was
just writing down all my thoughts and when I didn’t know the answer to something
I did research about it. Then I started measuring the time I spent on my PC… I
became more self-aware of what I was doing on my computer and saw that it
mattered! I started using tools like freedom and RescueTime to measure and steer
my productivity. It is still giving me great insights but what do I do with it?

What if learning is creating
What if my previous model of productivity was based on a flawed assumption? That
learning and creating is something totally different. What if that’s not true?

I think that the best way to learn is not by being passive and listen or read.
At least… Not for kiting. Not for spanish. And I start to understand that it’s
also not the case for coding… I have to get it into my fingers because knowing
something is not the same as being able to putting it into practice. That’s why
I think that my whole determination of having been productive was based on a big
flaw: thinking that this passive learning BS is helping me.

My new theory is the following:

 * passive learning, a.k.a. information consumption generates possibility,
   choices and doubt.
 * active learning a.k.a. creation a.k.a. information generation generates
   decision and certainty.

My statistics this year
The first ~100 days that I’ve used this laptop, this is what my RescueTime has
measured.



I haven’t reached my goals. I have spent 64 hours on social media (not taking
into account my phone), and I coded just 85 minutes per day out of a 6.5 hours
of ‘working’ every day.

Change


From now on:

 * I will focus on a active way of learning: Learn by actually coding. “Getting
   it in the fingers” as we like to call it in the Netherlands.
 * My objective measure of productivity will no longer be amount of hours
   worked. It will be the amount of time spent in the editor and console.
 * Consistent repetition for momentum

100 Days of groundhog day


When searching for a way to motivate myself to do this, thinking heavily about
repetition and practice, I found this

article. It inspired me to do a similar challenge — I call it the #GroundhogDay
#100DaysOfCode Challenge

Rules:

 * Wake up 6:00AM and code
 * The next day, I start with a new project from 0



I can apply one cheat. If I can actually spend more than 8 hours of non-stop
coding without getting stuck, I will continue where I left the next day or any
other day. I can use that project. This keeps me motivated and I won’t get stuck
on projects anymore longer than a day.

And it makes sense too. If I don’t crash I can keep driving and don’t have to
get a new car every time.
