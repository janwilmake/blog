# The most complex app I ever made, made it to both app stores!

Last week I 'finished' MasterCrimeZ [https://mastercrimez.nl]. Wel... It's not
finished yet, because this is never gonna be finished. It's a with many options,
but there's always room for more!



> Around December, I let old players from the web-based game that ran between 2006
and 2016 play the BETA. At some point, they were really enjoying the game, and
they were almost all online at the same time (which were about 10 people).


In the end, after 4 months of programming, I called the app 'finished' and
released it to the iOS Appstore and the Google Play store. It got through it!

After this app I started with Communify [https://communify.cc]. It needs a lot
of work still, but it's gonna be epic.
