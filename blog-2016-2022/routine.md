# Routine

It's Sunday, november 19th and I'm sitting at the table in the living room of my 
Eat Code Kite Repeat [http://eatcodekiterepeat.com] house, feeling a little bit
sick: I catched a cold, with no central heating system it can become cold at
night, even in the south of Spain... Yesterday I picked up my routine again,
because I've been a little sloppy with the morning part lately. Time for a
strict definition.

As a solo-entrepreneur having a proper routine is very important. Especially in
the beginning, you are probably the only one that actually knows how well it's
going and there will be nobody that helps you or looks over your shoulder, so
you better make sure you keep the ball rolling.


In the past year I have experimented a lot, but I seem to have arrived at a
routine that works very well for me. I developed this routine in Lisbon, and in
Tarifa I added the daily kiting to it, which works out awesome. My routine can
be divided in an eat-routine (morning), code routine, kite routine and repeat
routine. In this post, I will explain them in detail.


Principles

 1. Short breaks of 5 minutes after every Pomodoro. Long break (15 min) when I
    feel like I need it.
    
    
 2. In the breaks, take time to round things up, time to relax, and make a plan
    for the coming pomodoro
    
    
 3. After a hard task, try something easy/light. Something I’ve done before,
    preferably.
    
    
 4. Decide, commit, focus, progress —-> Choose a Pomodoro for the coming 2
    hours… make a list of subtasks, and ban distractions. Do it
    
    

My EAT routine
7:00 Get up instantly

7:01 Workout, Listen some audio, meditate

This is the most important routine, because it gets me in the best state of mind
to start working. I started by separating all three but after getting used to
it, it's nice to save time and make the process quick and streamlined.

What workout? Doesn't matter, as long as you measure results and try to improve.
This is part of the mindset. For me, exercising is not about getting stronger.
It's about understanding and not forgetting the mindset of setting your own
goals and achieving them, and feeling the power that comes from within, so that
you can stop seeking for external powers and pleasures to lift you up.

What audio? A mix of the following, doesn't really matter, as long as you can
listen to something in the breaks to wake up and send input to your mind. If you
actually learn something from it, that's a huge win!

 * iTunes listening books
 * Spanish Audio course
 * Motivational Youtube videos
 * Guided Meditation, for example Headspace
 * No audio, but get intrinsic message that I repeat in my head (meditate)

What Meditation? I start with being with myself by concentrating on breath. I
slowly move to my body and surroundings and then I start thinking about the day.
What can I achieve, today? What will make the most impact and is something I'm
looking up against? Why am I doing what I do again? What is the goal? These kind
of questions are the most important!

±7:45 After that, get a proper yet simple & quick breakfast, and start creating
a detailed plan for the first work session. The first work-session I try to
focus on the most important/hardest thing I have to solve because the morning is
the moment when I'm the sharpest and will have the most willpower.

±8-10 - Open laptop, work through the detailed plan, and close my laptop again.
If consciously distracted, close laptop and check in on the detailed plan again
before I open it again. No matter what! It is very important to not drift away
from the problem you're trying to solve.

My CODE routine
It's best to take some breaks while coding because sometimes it can be
frustrating, especially when implementing hard things it can be good to take a
break and return with a fresh mind.

Usually I try to do at least 3 stretches of 2+ hours with a small break in the
middle.

My KITE routine
 * If there's wind, go kiting
 * If not, go out for a little bit and enjoy the weather



Yeah, life's simple in Tarifa. That's not me btw, but #goals.

My REPEAT routine
 1. Diary, evaluate, plan next day
 2. Work a little more, if I feel like it (it happens more and more)
 3. Meditate/Read/Listen books, OR...
 4. ...Be social, if good reasons appear (events/people)

It is important to always evaluate and think about what you've accomplished. And
sleep early, tomorrow is going to be an important day!

Pitfalls
Throughout the past year, these were pitfalls I fell into on a regular basis.
Using some tools and this system, I try to avoid them:



 1. Getting distracted by over-analysing and over-planning. It is commonly
    called Analysis Paralysis [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis]
    . Use RescueTime [https://rescuetime.com/] and Freedom [http://freedom.to] 
    to ban out distractions. And yes, even Medium or reading books can be a
    distraction.
 2. Getting distracted by social media & e-mail: Again, I use Freedom
    [http://freedom.to] to block it all out during deep work.
 3. Getting distracted by my phone: I bought a Nokia 3310 2017 edition to get
    rid of this completely. I still have the urge to get back on my old phone
    when I see it lying around, so I usually hide it so I don't see it and stop
    thinking about it.
 4. Loosing faith in your startup: It can be hard some times. Things can (seem
    to) progress incredibly slow, and especially when you don't have a product
    out there yet, it can be daunting to work full-time on something alone
    without seeing results or getting feedback for long periods. The morning
    routine is great for keeping this from happening. If it still happens, it
    can be great to have a clear long-term plan and a well-defined unique value
    proposition and unfair advantage. Getting these things back in the top of
    your mind can boost your confidence.
 5. Having too many goals and overwhelm yourself By having one focus and one
    goal every week I try to keep my life as stress-free and simple as possible.
    You can't improve at all things at the same time, although improving your
    physical fitness and your mental fitness go very well together.
