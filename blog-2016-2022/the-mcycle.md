# Cycling through your life part III: The μCycle

 * Make iterations between improving all aspects and getting feedback as short
   as possible or ultimately continuous



 * Create a feedback loop. A growth spiral that iterates through creation and
   feedback as quickly as possible to stimulate learning.

Dream to create a goal...
Plan to get motivated...
Learn to be able to create...
Share this to get feedback...
And maybe you will dream differently afterward.
