# How to diminish distractions while being nomadic

This is how I try to diminish distractions to spend my time as effective as I
can:

 * Don't get distracted by your phone or computer. Write down important
   thoughts, but focus and concentrate on just one thing for as long as you can
   to stay sharp. Use Freedom.to [http://freedom.to/] to make it impossible to
   get distracted.
   
   
 * Solve attention pollution. Be here and now, even while on the internet. Read

 * Create habits for yourself so you don't have to doubt everything, even in the
   face of the habit of change (being nomadic). When coming to a new place, just
   choose a daily rhythm and go for it.
   
   
 * Grow your willpower by achieving self-set challenges and being open about it.

We are distracted hundreds of times a day, too many times to recover into focus.
See the book 'The Shallows: Impact of Internet on our brains' for some nice
statistics from 2008-2010 about internet and smartphone usage.

This is a good article on the fact that it takes a long time to recover from a
distraction and how distractions impact work. click
