# Expanding at the speed of light, and preserving it into eternity

Unless you can travel faster than light, I can't find a better goal for humanity
to strive for. In my opinion the purpose of life is to live which means to exist
and procreate. To multiply, and remain. 

In a competitive universe, which we arguably live in, in the end, the
intelligence that does so as efficiently as possible wins.

I think the right direction for us, is to start the evolution revolution
[/the-evolution-revolution/]. Once we have managed to do so on earth, we can
focus on expanding to other planets. The right direction becomes all directions.
We can use all earth's resources to travel to all directions as fast as possible
(the speed of light).

After having done that, it is not necessary for us to expand anymore, because we
have expanded in all directions already. It is therefore impossible to expand.
It is then probably the best to preserve what we have built on earth. We have to
protect ourselves from future alien civilisations that we didn't encounter yet.

How to protect yourself from something you don't know? Probably it's best to
keep gaining knowledge about possibilities and minimise risk of these
possibilities impacting us in a bad way.
