# EAT CODE KITE REPEAT at the NOMAD INCUBATOR in KITESURF HEAVEN: TARIFA ESPAÑA

EAT CODE KITE REPEAT is the new community I'm setting up, which is aimed at
finding and connecting software developers and entrepreneurs with a vision that
have a passion for kitesurfing.

As of September 2017, I have started a homebase for this community in Tarifa
España called the 'Nomad Incubator Tarifa'.

The first few days I went exploring all facets of the village: the nightlife,
the beaches, the mountains nearby... There is a lot to do here!

Also, I researched what type of board to buy, bought a mountainbike, and
researched the kitesurf conditions [https://explorawatersports.com/tarifa-wind/]
.

From next week I will have an apartment from which I will be able to quickly go
to the kite spot (especially for poniente-days) and focus on work.

From next week, I will try to get into a regular rhythm: I call it the EAT CODE
KITE REPEAT Rhythm. I also made a Facebook group for people that like to adopt
this lifestyle: Click here [https://www.facebook.com/groups/743789522496000].

My lifestyle looks roughly like the following:

 * [EAT] Wake up 8AM. Do some exercises, listen to Spanish Audio Course, have
   coffee & breakfast and take a shower.
 * [CODE] Start working at 9AM. Code in 2-hour sessions until 3PM. Lunch has to
   be quick and should barely take any time.
 * [KITE] Go kiting for a few hours and chill a little on the beach. Have dinner
   after a good session!
 * [REPEAT] Look back on the day, plan the next day and go to bed early in order
   to wake up stoked the next day.

I will keep everyone up to date using this blogpost! Until now, I think Tarifa
is an amazing place!
