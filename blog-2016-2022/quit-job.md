# Quitting my job, living cheap, working full time on my startup(s). Saving hundreds of euro's every month.

I quit my job to work on my own startup(s). I want my savings to last as long as
possible, so I decided I want to live more economically. 

 * I cancelled Ziggo (the Internet + TV subscription) saving me €54 per month. I
   switched my phone plan to KPN 5G Unlimited (calling, SMS, and internet) for
   €29 a month. Instead of having internet at home, I will just create a hotspot
   on my phone from now on. The internet plan on my phone has faster internet
   speeds anyway!
 * I bought a Fridge. This allows me to buy cheaper vegetables and meat, and go
   to the supermarket less often, making it easier to focus on buying cheap
   groceries and not get tempted. I spent about €250 a month on food. This will
   become about €75 a month, saving me €175 a month
 * I bought a filter-coffee machine. I had a Dolce Gusto machine, which cost me
   €29 a month for 4 cups of coffee per day. Now I can buy filter coffee, which
   will cost €5 per month, saving me €24 a month.
 * I quit a handful of subscriptions, saving me €50 a month

All in all, this saves me €300 a month. My total costs of living go down to
€1000 a month. With housing- and care-benefits, and a profit from my savings
investments, I earn about €446 a month. This means I loose around €554 a month.
With my savings (about €20k), this makes it possible to keep living like this
for 3 years!

This sets the stage for a new adventure: working full time on multiple startups
for at least 3 years. We'll see where it goes from here!
